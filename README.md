# My personal website
### Live site: https://www.joshthecomposer.com/
I hope you enjoy my website! I will be updating it periodically and adding things as I think of them.
### Goals:
* Build a personal website from scratch which showcases both my software development *and* music portfolios in an organized and pleasing manner
* Design my own custom audio player using JavaScript and CSS to showcase both my coding skills and my music skills.
* Design a backend with Python to store data for a newsletter.
* Implement *some* form of fun API just to get used to the process - *yet to be determined*
*
